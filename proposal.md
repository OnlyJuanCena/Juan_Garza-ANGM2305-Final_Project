## Description
For this assignment, I plan on using the PyGame Library to recreate a key historical creation of the video game industry: Pong.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Recreate the iconic gameplay of pong and allow for one player fighting against a basic computer opponent.
- Feature 2
	- Keep track of player score.
- Feature 3 
	- Increase game difficulty as time goes on.

## Challenges
- Creating colision boxes that feel fair.
- Making multiple objects interact with each other.
- Add sound effects to enhance the game feel.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Briefly describe what is the ideal outcome?
The ideal outcome is for the game to start with a small delay and continue until the the player loses. I wanna try to add a simple background with a numerical on-screen score and to have acceleration with the player controller. Additionally I'd like the game to work in fullscreen and/or windowed mode.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Briefly describe the bare essential for a good working outcome?
At the bare minimum, I want the game to open, the ball to bouce back and forth, and for the scoring system to work.

## Milestones

  1. Create Player Controller
  2. Create game area

- Week 2
  1. Create Ball Physics
  2. Create Computer opponent.

- Week 3-4 (Final)
