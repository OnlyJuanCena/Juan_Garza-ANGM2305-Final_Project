# PyBall: Retro Edition

## Description
PyBall: Retro Edition is a recreation of the classic Pong game using the PyGame library.
This project features a single-player mode where the player competes against a basic computer opponent.
The game includes sound effects, score tracking, and increasing difficulty as the ball speeds up as each round goes on before eventually 
displaying a winner and closing after the first person (or computer) wins three rounds.

## Features
- Classic Pong gameplay with a player vs. computer mode.
- Increase in game difficulty as time progresses.
- In-depth player controls.
- Sound effects for ball hits and scoring.

## Controls
